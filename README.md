# Warehouse Management System
Warehouse Group 2: Samantha Miller, Jacques Troussard, Taylor Dohmen

## Section 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to describe and provide a detailed plan for the
the warehouse management system project in Computer Science (CPSC)-430.  The
audience of this document includes the writers&#39; professor Dr. Karen Anewalt
and BGCVA&#39;s representative, Gusty Cooper.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this project to is provide a software application that manages
automobile inventory for a primary and mobile warehouses, including sales and
invoices.  Cooper represents the primary stakeholder in this project.  The
project will upload, display, and search products that BGCVA sells.  This
application intends to improve organization and track business statistics for
the stakeholders.

### 1.3 Document Conventions

The document follows this terminology:

-  &quot;**SHALL**&quot; indicates a hard requirement that **SHALL** be
implemented.

-  &quot;**SHOULD**&quot; indicates a soft requirement that may be
implemented if time allows.

### 1.4 Document Overview

This document is organized as follows:

- Section 2 provides a general description of the system, including its
  overview, user characteristics, functional requirements, and constraints.
- Section 3 contains the project&#39;s schedule, including the approach,
  milestones deliverables, work breakdown structure, Gannt chart, and task
dependency diagram.
- Appendix A contains a glossary of commonly used terms.
- Appendix B provides examples and explanations of project documents.
- Appendix C enumerates the document contributions by each member in the group.

## Section 2: Project Description

### 2.1 Project Scope

The warehouse management system will be an application by which BGCVA employees
can manage inventory and sales records. It will digitally store information
about each warehouse, the products in each warehouse, sales that have taken
place, and the employees. Through the system, employees will be able to query
product and sales data, generate sales reports and invoices, and update
inventory. Inventory updates will consist of operations related to transferring
items between warehouses, inputting newly ordered items into the system, and
selling items to customers. All databases will be hosted on a server in the
cloud, and will be accessible via a browser interface. Only employees will be
able to access the system, and will need to login with a unique username and
password to take advantage of system functions.

### 2.2 User Characteristics

This web application interfaces with the clients as an internal tool to track
products, sales, and employee metrics. There should be administrators who
interface with the system to provide technical support, but have no need to
engage with the product, unless other users need help. They may be able to
update product fields and perform site maintenance as needed. They should have
access to every feature on the site for testing, explanation, and future
improvement. There are warehouse managers who should also have full site access,
except for administrator pages, for training and business information, including
managing products and employees as well as their metrics. The clients include
sales associates who move product and make sales using their mobile warehouse
vans to local customers. Sales associates should not have access to the user
accounts and metrics portions of the site. Administrators, managers, and sales
associates should be able to access the &quot;working&quot; parts of the site,
including searching for products, creating and displaying invoices, and
importing product files to update the system. Customers are local automobile
repair and supply shops who buy the products the sales associates offer.
Customers and the general public may not login or create accounts to use the
application because it remains an tool internal to the business and its
associates.

### 2.3 Functional Requirements

_2.3.1. Log into System_

_Description:_ A user accessing the site has a email and password to use the
application.

_Main Flow:_

1. User accesses site by Internet browser.
2. System displays login screen, prompting email and password fields, and a
Login button.
3. User types email and password and clicks Login.
4. System verifies matching user information and displays the Home page of the
site.

_Alternate Flow A:_

1. User accesses site page that requires login, like the Home or Import page.
2. The system redirects any user without a session to the Login page.

_Alternate Flow B:_

3. The user types either the email or password.  The Login button is disabled
until both fields are filled.

_Alternate Flow C:_

3. The user types a wrong email or password.

4. The system checks the provided information and returns a error message
proclaiming the email or password was invalid.

5. Repeat until Main Flow 4 is met.

_2.3.2. Log out of System_

_Description:_ A logged-in user exits the site.

_Main flow:_

1. A logged-in user clicks the Logout button on the menu.
2. The system removes the user from the session and displays the Login page of
the application.

_2.3.3. Search for Product_

_Description:_ Any user can search for products based on warehouse location,
product name, or product number.

_Main Flow:_

1. A logged-in user navigates to the Search page via the menu bar.
2. The system displays the Search page, which offers options to search for
products by warehouse location, product name, or product number, as well as
Search and Reset buttons.
3. The user enters requirements in the form and clicks Search.
4. The system queries all related information and displays all product
information in the table.

_Alternate Flow A:_

3. The user clicks the Reset button instead of Search.

4. The system clears the fields of the search boxes.

_Alternate Flow B:_

5. The user clicks the Reset button after searching.

6. The system clears the returned table and search fields.

_Import Inventory File_

_Description_: Any user should be able to upload a CSV file into the system
which specifies what changes are being made to the warehouse inventory. The
system should then update the product database to account for the specified
changes.

_Main Flow_:

1. User navigates to an inventory management page and selects the option to
upload an inventory management file.
2. System displays an upload window including a file explorer and upload button.
3. User navigates the file explorer, selects the desired file, and clicks the
upload button.
4. The system parses the file and updates the inventory database based on the
file&#39;s specification. If the operation is time intensive, the system should
display a progress indicator to the user.
5. The system displays a message informing the user that the operation was
executed successfully.

_Alternate Flow A_:

1. The system parses the file and finds that it is improperly formatted.
2. The System displays a message informing the user that the file is improperly
formatted. Return to Main Flow 1.

_Alternate Flow B_:

1. The system parses the file and finds that there is an invalid operation.
2. The System displays a message informing the user of bad operation. Return to
Main Flow 1.

_Description_: A sales associate should be able to select a subset of their
mobile warehouse&#39;s inventory and create and invoice for the sale of those
items.

_Main Flow_:

1. Sales associate navigates to a Create Invoice page.

of the products in the sales associate&#39;s mobile warehouse with areas to
specify the sold quantity of each item, and a submit button.
3. Sales associate enters the customer&#39;s information, specifies the quantity
of each item being sold, and selects submit.
4. System validates that the quantities are not larger than the quantity of the
item in stock.
5. System generates invoice based on the price and quantities of the items sold
and customer information given and saves the sale record in the database.
6. System updates inventory database to account for the sold items.
7. System displays message indicating that the sale was successfully documented.

_Alternate Flow A_:

1. System finds that a sale quantity is larger than the inventory quantity and
displays a message indicating this. Return to Main Flow 2.
